**Description**:

[openclassrooms.com](openclassrooms.com) - DA Python - [Project 7 - Cr√©ez GrandPy Bot, le papy-robot](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/projects/158/assignment)

This project's objective is to create a chat bot, within it's own webpage.
The server runs on Python's Flask, UI designs are managed with Bootstrap, and interactions are geared through Jquery.

Like a messenger application, ***you*** (*the user*) type your message in the input box.
***PapyBot*** (the *chat bot program*) will answer you, to the best of his capacity, he might be a bit senile at times.

PapyBot will parse your query, filter relevent words, question Wikipedia API and Gmap API. If He can come up with informations, he will generate a random pharse along with the 2 first sentences of the *most* relevent wikipage. If a map is available, it will display it. However, if Papy doesn't understand your query, he will tell you to rephase (Becareful he might become nasty).

This program has a *'mid range'* memory, if you refresh the page, all previous interactions will be erased (told you Papy was a bit senile). Otherwise as long you keep interacting with him, the conversation remains available on screen.

**Enjoy!**
